My Portfolio Website

The goal of this website is to adequately communicate my professional competencies.  It should highlight bullets similar to the ones on my resume, but also prove that I have an eye for design and an ability to do some code.  Will keep it HTML / CSS / JavaScript in order to follow the KISS methodology.

- [Matthew Williams](http://findmatthew.com) - this one has great animation effects
- [Rafael Caferati](https://caferati.me) - this one incorporates a game
